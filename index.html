        <p>Lord Eddard Stark, ruler of the North, is summoned to court by his old friend, King Robert Baratheon, to

          as the King's Hand. Eddard reluctantly agrees after learning of a possible threat to the King's life. Eddard's
          bastard son Jon Snow must make a painful decision about his own future, while in the distant east Viserys
          Targaryen plots to reclaim his father's throne, usurped by Robert, by selling his sister in marriage.</p>
